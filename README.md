## Head of DevRel and DX Engineer at Seasoned

I've been developing web apps for about 20 years. I love OSS, TypeScript, Remix and I'm co-creator of [domain-functions](https://github.com/SeasonedSoftware/domain-functions).

I'm currently creating content, developing libraries and fighting TS so others don't have to!
