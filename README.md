## DevRel and DX Engineer

I've been developing web apps for about 20 years. I love OSS, TypeScript, Remix and I'm creator of [atmp](https://github.com/gustavoguichard/atmp), [make-service](https://github.com/gustavoguichard/make-service), and co-creator of [domain-functions](https://github.com/SeasonedSoftware/domain-functions).

I'm currently creating content, developing libraries and fighting TS so others don't have to!
