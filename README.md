I've been a software engineer for about 20 years, starting as a freelance web designer as a kid. More recently, I worked as a Sr. Software Engineer for tech startups in Silicon Valley and today, I'm a DX Engineer & Tech Lead at [Seasoned](https://github.com/SeasonedSoftware), where I design reusable architectures that boost developer productivity and reduce our startups' time to market.

Away from the computer, I'm also a proud father, husband, certified Yoga teacher, and long time surfer.
