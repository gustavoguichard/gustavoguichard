I've been developing web apps for about 20 years. 
I've worked as a Sr. Software Engineer for tech startups in Silicon Valley and nowadays I'm a DX Engineer & Tech Lead at Seasoned, where I design reusable architectures that boost developer productivity and reduce our startups' time to market.

Away from the computer, I'm also a proud father, husband, certified Yoga teacher, and long time surfer.
